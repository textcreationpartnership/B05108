            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> Why the Report of the Committee for Security finding that the Tack of the <hi>Pole</hi> Impoſed in the Year <hi>1693,</hi> ſhould be turned to a Collection, ſhould be Approven in Parliament.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, Becauſe it is well known, that the foreſaid Pole being the firſt general Pole that ever was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was at that time greatly miſtaken, and over-valued by all that concerned themſelves in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Tackſ-men who were the Higheſt Offerers, by the Condition of their Tack, had Ground and Right to expect to have had the Benefit of the Act of Parliament, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſaid Pole, and of the whole Contents and Orders therein ſet down, ſpecially as to the taking up of the Liſts and Rolls, and making due Returns thereof, which yet was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to them for the far, far greateſt part of the Kingdom, which rendred the uplifting of of the ſaid Pole-money in effect impoſſible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That upon Tryal, which could not poſſibly be diſcovered before, the Act of Parliament, and the Degrees, Qualities, and Branches thereof, were found to Labour under ſeveral Doubts and Defects, which made an intrinſick Inſufficiency in the Pole it ſelf, as was fully cleared to the Committee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That if the Tackſmen ſhould be neceſſitat to hold their Tack, they muſt exact the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druples, to which their Tack gives them full Right, and what an Oppreſſion and Confuſion this would prove to the whole Countrey, and how great a hinderance to the new Pole, is obvious to every body.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His Majeſty in his Letter to the Lords of Theſaury, and Exchequer, ſuperceded all Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt the Tackſmen, in regard he would not have the Quadruples exacted, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Commiſſioner his Grace anent the ſame.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is Nottour to all Members of Parliament, that the new Pole hath been Contrived and Digeſted with Advantages, far above the old Pole; and that theſe Advantages are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eſtimat to a far greater Value than the former Pole; and yet upon Tryal, it is now ſeen how little is offered for it, Which evidenitly demonſtrats that the Tack of the former Pole, did labour not only under the Difficulties and Diſappointments above-mentioned; But likeways, under ſuch an intrinſick Inſufficiency, as in all Equity pleads for the foreſaid Collection.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſeing that the Tackſmen were Diſappointed, as to the plain Conditions of their Tack, anent the Liſts and Rolls, and that the Pole it ſelf was Diſcovered upon Tryal, to be Inſufficient and Imperfect: and that the Quadruples to which the the Tackſmen have undoubted Right, would be an infinite Prejudice to the Countrey. It is confidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, the High and Honourable Court of Parliament, will approve the Report of their Committee, and free the Tackſmen of their ſaid Tack, and Declare them to be only Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as Collectors, ſpecially ſeing that they are content to Accompt with all Exactneſs, and by whatſomever rational Rules the Parliament ſhall think fit to Preſcribe. And that in a Word, it is viſible, that if the Parliament do not graciouſly Interpoſe in this Matter, not only the Countrey muſt ſuſtain an irreparable Prejudice; but many honeſt Noblemen and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who intended to ſerve the Countrey in this Matter, with great ſincerity, muſt be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Overcharged, if not Ruined.</p>
